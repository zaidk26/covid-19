        <![CDATA[<p><span class="fontstyle0">Media Release<br />
31 March 2020<br /></span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">As at today, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 1353. This is an increase of 46 from the previously reported cases.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
The provincial breakdown is as follows:<br /></span></p><table class="NormalTable"><tbody><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">GAUTENG </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">633</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">WESTERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">325</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">KWAZULU – NATAL </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">179</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">FREE STATE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">74</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">NORTH WEST </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">8</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">MPUMALANGA </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">12</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">LIMPOPO </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">14</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">EASTERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">12</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">NORTHERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">6</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">UNALLOCATED </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">90</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>Report of Two More Deaths</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">It is with sadness that we announce that two more deaths.<br />
&#8211; A 79 year old male from Gauteng Province, who presented with respiratory distress<br />
&#8211; A 46 year old female from KwaZulu-Natal, who had an underlying condition of hypertension chronic asthma and at the time of admission, presented with an acute asthmatic attack</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
Therefore, to date, this brings the total number of COVID-19 related deaths to five. </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">We convey our sincere condolences to the loved ones of these departed citizens.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br /></span><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>Positive Cases on MSC Cruise</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">We have previously received reports of two confirmed COVID-19 cases that were on the MSC Cruise. These cases are from KZN and Free State. We want to make this very important announcement to the public:<br />
In relation to the MSC ORCHESTRA Cruise Liner that left Durban on 28th February 2020 to the Portuguese Island and returned on the 2</span><span class="fontstyle0">nd </span><span class="fontstyle0">March 2020;<br />
And in relation to the second cruise with the same vessel on the 13</span><span class="fontstyle0">th </span><span class="fontstyle0">March 2020 and returning on the 16</span><span class="fontstyle0">th </span><span class="fontstyle0">March 2020;</p><p>IF YOU WERE PART OF THESE CRUISES, PLEASE KNOW THAT YOU ARE A CONTACT AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU. Please make contact with the Departments of Health in KwaZulu-Natal and Free State.</p><p></span><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>The Queen Mary 2</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">On 27 March 2020 a cruise ship, The Queen Mary 2, docked in the outer anchorage of the Durban port of entry after being denied entry into the port. This was due to the fact that a number of passengers on board that ship had been reported to be exhibiting flu like symptoms. The ship had departed Fremantle, Australia, on 16 March 2020.</p><p>All the passengers on board the ship are not South African however there were six South African crew members working on the ship<br />
A total of 26 people were tested for COVID-19 and all tested negative.</p><p>Today the ship was allowed to enter the dock to permit the the South African crew members to disembark the ship and for the ship itself to take on fuel, water and supplies. No foreign nationals were allowed to disembark. The ship will henceforth depart for its destination</p><p>The six South African crew members have now been transported to a quarantine facility in in Durban.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>Deployment of Community Health Care Workers as announced by President Ramaphosa</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">Fellow South Africans, as the Honourable President announced yesterday, 10 000 Community Health Care Workers will be deployed across the country to conduct door to door screening in our most vulnerable communities. I must emphasize that they will be conducting screening and not tests: the field workers will not conduct any tests but will refer any persons suspected of having Coronavirus to the nearest CHC, clinic or hospital. I also want to emphasize that, at this stage, only PCR tests will be conducted at health care facilities.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
We are exploring the use of rapid antibody tests and Gene Xpert tests in the future when we have to process high numbers. The Ministerial Advisory Committee and the South African Health Products Authority (SAHPRA) are working hard to investigate all options and come to a consensus.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
The deployment will be a phased, targeted approach: today 5400 field workers have already been mobilized and a dry run was done today at Alexandra by Gauteng Department of Health. The pilot was planned to do 10 households per hour- we will look at the report tomorrow to determine how effective this was and shape future deployment.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
Other areas to be targeted at this stage are Diepsloot and Khayelitsha and by Friday 3 April we will have extended to other high density areas of concern.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
We are redeploying our own CHW’s from national and provinces and we are very grateful to donor organizations, such as PEPFAR, who will partner with us to ensure that we are able to boost numbers and double what we have already fielded. Mobile testing units will be rolled out across the country and I look forward to launching some of these in the Free State on Thursday.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
We also wish to reassure South Africans that the field workers, frontline workers and all workers coming into contact with COVID-19 positive patients and other infectious diseases will be provided with adequate personal protective equipment and no worker will be fielded without the necessary protection. Although we know there is a global crisis of PPE shortage, we have been very hard at work as a department and as a global community, partnering with business, to secure the availability of PPE</span><span class="fontstyle3">’</span><span class="fontstyle0">s during this time of need. We have heard the concerns of our health care workers and<br />
engaged Unions on this matter. We wish to reassure our valued health professionals that their safety is in the forefront of our agenda as we cannot afford to lose one health care worker to  COVID-19 or any disease for that matter. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>Flattening the Curve</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">Looking at the trend we are seeing of the day to day new infections we are cautiously optimistic that we may not see the numbers rising as high as we had initially projected. </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">We should, however, bear in mind that we are approaching Winter which could change the dynamics entirely. Be that as it may, it is clear from looking at other successful countries that we, As South Africa, can make a real impact and flatten the curve if we </span><span class="fontstyle0">continue to observe the regulations that have been set out by government. </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">Therefore I would like to encourage South African to continue to stay at home, observe good hygienic practice and work together with government- this way we have a real chance </span><span class="fontstyle0">of containing the spread of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
Dr Zwelini Mkhize<br />
Minister of Health<br />

Attention: News Editors<br />
Date: 29 March 2020</p><p>*MINISTER MBALULA RELAXES PUBLIC TRANSPORT OPERATING HOURS FOR SOCIAL GRANT BENEFICIARIES *</p><p>Following the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa on the days social grants would be paid, a number of industry bodies has made representations on the relaxation of hours public transport vehicles are allowed to operate. A similar request was made by the Minister of Social Development, Minister Lindiwe Zulu.</p><p>Having considered Minister Zulu’s request and representations made by various industry bodies, including the taxi industry, I have decided to amend the Public Transport Directions in order to accommodate grant beneficiaries.</p><p>Effective from tomorrow, 30 March 2020 until Friday, 3 April 2020, buses and taxis will be permitted to operate from 05:00 until 20:00 in order to cater to the transportation needs of society’s most vulnerable. The exercise of social distance by all those using public transport must be observed and enforced. We will issue further Directions in this regard.</p><p>Grant recipients are required to carry their Identity Documents and South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) cards when traveling on public transport, to assist law enforcement efforts.</p><p>Issued by :<br />

        <![CDATA[<p><span class="fontstyle0">Media Release<br />
28 March 2020<br /></span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">Fellow South Africans, as at today, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 1187. We must outrightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction in the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and ready for today’s reporting.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
The provincial breakdown is as follows:<br /></span></p><table class="NormalTable"><tbody><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">GAUTENG </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">533</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">WESTERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">271</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">KWAZULU – NATAL </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">156</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">FREE STATE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">68</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">NORTH WEST </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">6</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">MPUMALANGA </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">10</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">LIMPOPO </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">11</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">EASTERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">10</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">NORTHERN CAPE </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">5</span></td></tr><tr><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">UNALLOCATED </span></td><td width="200"><span class="fontstyle0">117</span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class="fontstyle2">HEALTHWORKERS INFECTED:<br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">We have noted with concern a number of confirmed COVID-19 cases of health workers who work both in the private and public hospitals. This includes doctor and nurses. We mention this because health workers are in the frontline of this battle. They are exposed not only to their families but to the patients who they are meant to treat.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">Some of the confirmed COVID-19 cases that involve health workers are as follows: </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">&#8211; In Limpopo, 1 medical doctor tested positive after he had travelled abroad for holiday started experiencing symptoms on his return. He immediately decided to quarantine himself. This young doctor remained in quarantine to ensure that he does not transmit the virus to other people. His 14 day quarantine period has ended and we are pleased to report that his results have now been confirmed negative.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
&#8211; In Mpumalanga, 1 medical doctor who had also travelled for a holiday abroad returned to the Province with symptoms which emerged a few days after he returned. Before then, he had been having interactions with staff and patients. He then tested positive and was quarantined. This led to other health workers who had come into contact with him to be screened, quarantined and tested. A decision was also made for that section of the hospital to be closed in order to disinfect it. This has been completed and it will be reopening during the course of next week.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
&#8211; In Free State, we have received a report that 3 doctors, 1 nurse and 1 neurophysicist have tested positive for COVID-19.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">&#8211; In Gauteng, 6 medical doctors have been infected in Gauteng. All these health workers are in a good medical condition with most of them having mild or no symptoms. It is only one doctor in the Free State aged 70, who is in ICU. It must be emphasised that none of these health workers were infected by patients that they were treating. They came into contact with their family members, friends and other colleagues who had tested positive for COVID-19. All individuals who were identified as contacts of these health workers have been put in quarantine and are being monitored.<br /></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class="fontstyle2">FLU VACCINES<br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">We must inform our people that South Africa received a very limited stock of flu vaccines. These are pre ordered a year in advance. At the time the country (both public and private) placed its orders, we had not anticipated this COVID-19 pandemic. This means that as it stands, our flu vaccines are understocked. </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">As government we have engaged with the pharmaceutical industry and it became clear that the distribution of this vaccine has to be rationalised and prioritised. We have therefore taken </span><span class="fontstyle0">a decision that health workers in the country will be given priority in receiving the flu vaccine. This is precipitated by the fact that the country cannot afford to have them sick especially as the flu season approaches. This is one of the major lessons that we have learnt from countries that have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
We therefore plead for the understanding of all South Africans who may unfortunately not have access to the flu vaccine this year.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br /></span><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>RESEARCH TRIAL</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">We are pleased that South Africa is participating in the Public Health Emergency Solidarity Trial that has been initiated by the World Health Organisation to conduct a clinical trial to find effective treatment for COVID-19.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
WHO has convened an independent group of experts to review evidence from laboratory, animal and clinical studies to prioritize treatments for inclusion in the trial. This independent group identified the following treatment options for inclusion in the trial:<br />
&#8211; Remdesivir : a drug which was previous used in an Ebola trial;<br />
&#8211; Lopinavir/ritonavir : a licensed treatment for HIV/AIDS<br />
&#8211; Lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta-1a : used for multiple sclerosis;<br />
&#8211; Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine : drugs used to treat malaria and rheumatology conditions respectively</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
All participating countries will adhere to the same methodology in order to facilitate the worldwide comparison of unproven treatments. Other countries that have already confirmed their participation in this trial are Argentina, Bahrain, Canada, France, Iran, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and Thailand. The South African Solidarity research team is led by Professors Helen Rees and Jeremy Nel, working 30 senior academics, researchers and clinicians from eight medical schools in the country (WITS, SMU, UP, UCT, Stellenbosch, NMU, UKZN, UFS, and the SA Military Health Service). They will be undertaking the study in fourteen leading hospitals across the country.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br /></span><span class="fontstyle2"><strong>CITIZENS FROM WUHAN</strong><br /></span><span class="fontstyle0">Three weeks ago, His Excellency, President MC Ramaphosa bid farewell to our brave men and women from the SANDF, SAA pilots and crew members, and the National Department of Health doctors who were travelling to Wuhan, China to fetch our citizens. As it is known, they returned to South Africa and were staying at The Ranch Hotel, in Limpopo.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">We had assured all South Africans that these citizens were all negative, they did not present any symptoms and therefore did not pose any risk of infection. However, we took extra precautions and quarantined them for a 14 day period. On arrival medical screening and</span><span class="fontstyle0">COVID-19 tests were conducted. They all came out negative. We are very pleased to report to South Africans that these citizens conducted their second test in preparation for their exit.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">These have all come out negative. They are therefore being prepared for vacating the Ranch Hotel. </span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0">We take this opportunity to appreciate the Limpopo Provincial Government and the people of Limpopo who despite their initial reservation, they came out in full support and assisted us in making this mission a success.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
We also thank the Ranch Hotel and all its workers who were prepared to serve our compatriots, despite this pandemic being taboo in our country at the time. They have done a sterling job in making our people feel welcome back at home. This, we sincerely appreciate.</span></p><p><span class="fontstyle0"><br />
Dr Zwelini Mkhize<br />
Minister of Health<br />

If possible, stay and sleep alone in a room that has a window with good air flowing through.<br />
You can talk to other family members and go outside, but you should stay at least 2 meters away from everyone at all times.<br />
You should not have visitors at your house during this time.<br />
One family member should be assigned as your caregiver. This exposes less of your family and also ensures that you and this caregiver can develop good habits so that they do not catch the virus from you.<br />
If these procedures are not possible, you should contact your health care worker or clinic for alternative options.</p><p><strong><u><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2979" src="https://sacoronavirus.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GIF-2020-03-28-21-38-45.gif" alt="" width="360" height="198" /><br />
What does quarantine affect your daily activities?<br /></u></strong>Sleep in your own room, if possible.<br />
Use your own plate, bowl, and utensils – do not share these or food with anyone.<em></em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>What hygiene practices do I need to follow?<br /></u></strong>Keep the 2-metre distance from other people at all times.<br />
Wash your hands before and after preparing food, before and after eating, and frequently throughout the day.<br />
Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.<br />
Cover your mouth with cloth or paper when coughing or sneezing.<br />
Your linen can be cleaned with detergent and water.<br />
